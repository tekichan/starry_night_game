Starry Night Game: Play this game at [https://tekichan.github.io/starry_night_game](https://tekichan.github.io/starry_night_game).

To commemorate Vincent van Gogh (1853 - 1890), one of greatest and influential painters
, nearly 130 years after his death, I created this game with face recognition. 

The game makes use of the following masterpieces:
- The Starry Night
- Self-Portrait
- Self-Portrait with Grey Felt Hat
- Self-portrait with Bandaged Ear and Pipe
- The Moonlight Sonata (by Ludwig van Beethoven)
